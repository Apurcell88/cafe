This project was built with React. It's a cafe website with a homepage and menu that shows off slick CSS animations and responsive design.
The data for this project is in a JSON file. I learned how to convert images to a format so they can be used on the website.
The images and the menu ideas were generated through AI. I also learned quite a bit about animations through this project. This project was NOT
intended to be full blown. It was to demonstrate intermediate knowledge of CSS and React.
